# Analysis of Seven-Day Anxiety and Depression Symptoms Frequency

## Overview
This project analyzes the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms among American adults during the COVID-19 pandemic using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey. The study involves data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization using Python, R, and SQL.

## Project Files
- **Anxiety_Analysis.py**: Python script for data exploration, cleaning, and visualization.
- **Anxiety_Analysis.txt**: SQL script to create and load data into a database and perform queries.
- **Anxiety_Analysis.pdf**: Detailed report on the analysis and findings.
- **Anxiety_Analysis.R**: R script for statistical analysis and visualization.
- **Anxiety_Analysis.ipynb**: Python code for Data Preprocessing.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **R**: ggplot2, dplyr
- **SQL**: Data querying and aggregation

## Data Processing Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and rename columns.
2. **Data Transformation**: Convert date fields, drop unnecessary columns.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Compute summary statistics and correlations.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Histograms and density plots
   - Scatter plots and box plots
   - Time series analysis

## How to Run the Project
### Python
```sh
python Anxiety_Analysis.py
```
### R
```r
source("Anxiety_Analysis.R")
```
### SQL
Execute the queries from `Anxiety_Analysis.txt` in a SQL environment.

## Research Questions
1. How has the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms changed over time?
2. What demographic factors are associated with higher symptom prevalence?
3. Are there significant regional variations in reported symptoms?

## Results & Findings
The analysis reveals significant patterns in mental health symptoms, with variations across demographics and geographic locations. The findings can guide policy decisions to address mental health concerns during crises.
